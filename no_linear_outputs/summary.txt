=== No-Linear-Terms Survive: Diagnostic Summary ===
Samples: 200,000 | Dim: 20 | FD step h=0.005

Centered case (should have NO linear term):
  ||∇L(0)||_∞ = 9.739e-04  (tolerance 5.0e-03)  -> PASS
  Max |directional grad| over 16 dirs = 2.904e-04  (tol 3.0e-03) -> PASS
  Hessian vs Covariance (Frobenius rel. err) = 8.223e-03  (tol 2.0e-02) -> PASS

Uncentered control (SHOULD show a linear leak):
  ||∇L(0)||_∞ (uncentered) = 1.940e-01  -> should be noticeably > 0

OVERALL: PASS
